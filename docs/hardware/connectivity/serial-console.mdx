# Connecting via Serial Console
The Comet-M has an inbuilt Serial Console that can be connected using a UART cable. Note, this also can be a **Hail Mary** solution if SSH or any other form of connectivity fails.

### What youâ€™ll need

- USB to UART cable - https://www.amazon.com/Serial-Adapter-Signal-Prolific-Windows/dp/B08BLKBK1K

### Connecting the USB to UART Cable

- The Debug UART pin mapping for the Comet-M is shown below.
    
    ```bash
    $ sudo apt add update
    ```
    
- Connect the male header pins of the UART cable to the Debug UART pins on the Comet-M

    {/* <ThemedImage

        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/img/uart-connection.gif'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/img/uart-connection.gif'),
        }}
    /> */}
    
- Connect the USB end of the cable to your machine.

### Connect to Serial Console on Linux

1. Open the Terminal on your Linux machine.
2. Type `dmesg | grep tty` to list the connected devices. Your UART bridge will appear as something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
    
    ```bash
    $ dmesg | grep tty
    [    0.000000] console [tty0] enabled
    [  542.711750] usb 1-4: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
    ```
    
3. Connect to your device using the screen command, followed by the device path and the baud rate, which is typically `115200`.
    
    ```bash
    $ sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
    ```
    
4. If everything is done correctly, you should now be connected to the device via the UART cable.

### Connect to Serial Console on MacOS

1. Open the  Terminal on your Mac.
2. Type `ls /dev/cu.*` to list the connected devices.
    
    ```bash
    $ ls /dev/cu.*
    /dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX
    ```
    
3. Identify the device that represents your UART bridge. It should look something like `/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX`.
4. Connect to the device using the screen command followed by the device path and the baud rate i.e. **`115200`**.
    
    ```bash
    $ screen /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX 115200 
    ```
    
5. If everything is done correctly, you should now be connected to the device via the UART cable.

### Connect to Serial Console on Windows

You will need the PuTTY application to connect to Serial Console on Windows. Follow this [tutorial on how to use PuTTY.](https://www.notion.so/Using-PuTTY-on-Windows-3fba4ed0345f4bff98e6a2ac741c1fb0?pvs=21)
